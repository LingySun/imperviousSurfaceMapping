# Step 1:
Run CCDC code in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and obtain the change detection results
# Step 2:
Run imperviousSurfacesMappingCode code in GEE, and obtain time series impervious surfaces mapping results
# Step 3:
Run postProcessing code in GEE, and obtain final time series impervious surfaces mapping results
